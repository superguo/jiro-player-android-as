ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* README.md
* default.properties
* proguard.cfg
* test/
* test/.classpath
* test/.project
* test/.settings/
* test/.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs
* test/AndroidManifest.xml
* test/assets/
* test/assets/sample.tja
* test/assets/sample2.tja
* test/proguard.cfg
* test/project.properties
* test/res/
* test/res/drawable-hdpi/
* test/res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png
* test/res/drawable-ldpi/
* test/res/drawable-ldpi/icon.png
* test/res/drawable-mdpi/
* test/res/drawable-mdpi/icon.png
* test/res/layout/
* test/res/layout/main.xml
* test/res/values/
* test/res/values/strings.xml
* test/src/
* test/src/com/
* test/src/com/superguo/
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/TJAFormat.java
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/TJAFormatParser.java
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/test/
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/test/TJAFormat.java
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/test/TJAFormatParser.java
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/test/TJAFormatTest.java
* test/src/com/superguo/jiroplayer/test/TestActivity.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
